PREREQUISITES
-------------

On Debian/Ubuntu you need the following packages:
    libjson-ruby sqlite3 packages libsqlite3-ruby1.8


RUNNING
-------

Run ./update.sh DIR

where DIR is the name of a directory where the data will be stored.

The file 'allpages.list' is currently not used. But because we get the
information from the wiki anyway, we just store it. Maybe in the future
it is of some use.
