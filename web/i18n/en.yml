                <p>Taginfo takes data about OSM tags from several sources and brings them
                together for easy browsing and discovery.</p>
                <p>Note that Taginfo only displays this data. If you want to change it, you
                have to go back to the source.</p>

            data_until_explanation: All edits until this time will be in the data, later edits might be.

                <p>Updates are currently done manually about once a week until they have proven
                to work reliably. It is planned to switch to daily updates as soon as
                possible.</p>

                <p>Here you can download the databases used by Taginfo. All the data is stored
                in <img src="/img/link-extern.gif" alt=""/><a class="extlink"
                href="http://www.sqlite.org/">Sqlite</a> databases. The database files are then
                packed with <img src="/img/link-extern.gif" alt=""/><a class="extlink"
                href="http://www.bzip.org/">bzip2</a>.</p>
                <p>If you don't want to download these databases, but need automated access to
                the data, you can also use the <a href="/about">API</a>.

                They often bring together data from several sources in interesting ways. Some
                of the reports can help with finding certain kinds of errors, such as popular
                keys without wiki pages.</p>
