<h1>About</h1>

<p>OpenStreetMap uses <b>tags</b> to add meaning to geographic objects. There
is no fixed list of those tags. New tags can be invented and used as needed.
Everybody can come up with a new tag and add it to new or existing objects.
This makes OpenStreetMap enormously flexible, but sometimes also a bit hard
to work with.</p>

<p>Whether you are contributing to OSM or using the data, there are always
questions like: What tags do people use for feature X? What tags can I use
for feature Y so that it appears properly on the map? Is the tag Z described
on the wiki actually in use and where?</p>

<p>Taginfo helps you by showing statistics about which tags are actually in the
database, how many people use those tags, where they are used and so on. It
also gets information about those tags from the wiki and from other places. Taginfo
tries to bring together all information about tags to help you understand
how they are used and what they mean.</p>

<h2>Sources</h2>

<p><b>Wiki:</b> The <img src="/img/link-extern.gif" alt=""/><a class="extlink" href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/">OSM wiki</a>
contains lots of documentation about tags but the information is far from complete.
Taginfo finds all pages beginning with 'Key:' or 'Tag:' and their
counterparts for other languages (for example 'DE:Key:...'). </p>
