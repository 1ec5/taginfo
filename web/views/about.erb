            <p>OpenStreetMap uses <b>tags</b> to add meaning to geographic objects. There
            is no fixed list of those tags. New tags can be invented and used as needed.
            Everybody can come up with a new tag and add it to new or existing objects.
            This makes OpenStreetMap enormously flexible, but sometimes also a bit hard
            to work with.</p>

            <p>Whether you are contributing to OSM or using the OSM data, there are always
            questions like: What tags do people use for feature X? What tags can I use
            for feature Y so that it appears properly on the map? Is the tag Z described
            on the wiki actually in use and where?</p>

            <p>Taginfo helps you by showing statistics about which tags are actually in the
            database, how many people use those tags, where they are used and so on. It
            also gets information about those tags from the wiki and from other places. Taginfo
            tries to bring together all information about tags to help you understand
            how they are used and what they mean.</p>

            <p>The software behind the taginfo sites is Open Source. It is available on
            <a class="extlink" href="https://github.com/joto/taginfo">GitHub</a>. We
            welcome any contributions.</p>

            <p>The taginfo software was created and is maintained by
            <a class="extlink" href="//wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/User:Joto">Jochen Topf</a>.
            The web design was created by
            <a class="extlink" href="http://www.ctd-studio.co.uk/">Christian Topf</a>.</p>

            <h3>Translations</h3>

            <p>We need translators for the taginfo user interface. See the <a
            href="/taginfo/translations">translations overview</a> for languages that need
            some work. Or you can always contribute translations into a new language. The
            <a class="extlink" href="https://github.com/joto/taginfo/tree/master/web/i18n">translation
            files</a> are on Github. More info on how to translate is on the
            <a class="extlink" href="//wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Taginfo/I18N">OSM wiki</a>.</p>

            <h3>Code</h3>

            <p>Programmers can
            <a class="extlink" href="https://github.com/joto/taginfo/">fork taginfo on Github</a>
            and play around with it. Each <a href="/sources">source</a> has its own import files
            (mostly shell scripts, Ruby, and SQL). The web interface is written in Ruby using
            the <a class="extlink" href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> toolkit and
            with lots of Javascript.</p>

            <h3>Running your own instance</h3>

            <p>You can run your own
            <a class="extlink" href="//wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Taginfo/Sites">taginfo site</a>,
            for instance with data for just your own country. Instructions are
            <a class="extlink" href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Taginfo/Running">on the OSM
            wiki</a>.</p>

            <h3>Bug reports and feature requests</h3>

            <p>Bug reports and feature requests should be directed to the <a class="extlink"
            href="https://github.com/joto/taginfo/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>. Or you can
            come talk to us on the mailing list.</p>

            <h3>Contact/Mailing list</h3>

            <p>Contact us on the

            if you have questions or want to help.</p>
            <p>If you are running your own taginfo instance, we recommend you join this list, too,
            so that you get important updates when the software changes.</p>

            <h3>API</h3>

            <p>Taginfo data can be accessed through a REST API. See the
            <a href="/taginfo/apidoc">API call documentation</a> for the details, some general information is
            <a class="extlink" href="//wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Taginfo/API">on the wiki</a>.
            The server running the taginfo API does not have unlimited resources.
            Please use the API responsibly. If in doubt contact the taginfo maintainers
            through the mailing list.</p>

            <h3>Download</h3>

            <p>The data available through taginfo is available under the
            <a class="extlink" href="//www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">same
            license as OpenStreetMap itself</a>.</p>
            <p>If you want to play around with the data itself, you can download the
            regularly updated databases used by taginfo. All the preprocessing is done for
            you. See the <a href="/download">download page</a> for more information.</p>
