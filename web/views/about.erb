            <p>OpenStreetMap uses <b>tags</b> to add meaning to geographic objects. There
            is no fixed list of those tags. New tags can be invented and used as needed.
            Everybody can come up with a new tag and add it to new or existing objects.
            This makes OpenStreetMap enormously flexible, but sometimes also a bit hard
            to work with.</p>
            <p>Whether you are contributing to OSM or using the OSM data, there are always
            questions like: What tags do people use for feature X? What tags can I use
            for feature Y so that it appears properly on the map? Is the tag Z described
            on the wiki actually in use and where?</p>
            <p>Taginfo helps you by showing statistics about which tags are actually in the
            database, how many people use those tags, where they are used and so on. It
            also gets information about tags from the wiki and from other places. Taginfo
            tries to bring together all information about tags to help you understand
            how they are used and what they mean. See a <a href="/sources">list of sources</a>
            taginfo uses.</p>

            <h3>API</h3>

            <p>Taginfo data can be accessed through a REST API. See the
            <a href="/taginfo/apidoc">API documentation</a> for the details, some general information is
            <a class="extlink" href="//wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Taginfo/API">on the OSM wiki</a>.
            The servers running the taginfo API do not have unlimited resources.
            Please use the API responsibly. If in doubt contact the maintainers of the
            site you are using or talk to us on the mailing list.</p>

            <h3>Download</h3>

            <p>If you want to play around with the data used by taginfo, you can download the
            regularly updated Sqlite database files. All the preprocessing is done for you.
            See the <a href="/download">download page</a> for a list of files. Note that
            some of these files can get quite large. If you want to download them regularly,
            talk to us first on the mailing list.</p>

            <h3>License</h3>
            <p>The data available through taginfo is licenced under ODbL, the
            <a class="extlink" href="//www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">same
            license as the OpenStreetMap data</a>.</p>

            <h3>Translations</h3>

            <p>We need translators for the taginfo user interface. See the <a
