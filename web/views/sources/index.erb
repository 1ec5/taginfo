<h1>Sources</h1>

<p>Taginfo takes data about OSM tags from several sources and brings them
together for easy browsing and discovery.</p>

<p>Note that Taginfo only displays this data. If you want to change it, you
have to go back to the source.</p>

<table class="list">
    <tr>
        <th></th><th>Source</th><th>Data until*</th><th>Last update run</th><th></th>
    </tr>
    <% Source.visible.each do |source| %>
    <tr>
        <td class="border"></td>
        <td><%= source.link_img + ' ' + source.link_name %>
        <td><%= source.data_until %></td>
        <td><%= source.update_start %> to <%= source.update_end %></td>
        <td class="border"></td>
    </tr>
    <% end %>
    <tr><th colspan="5"/></tr>
</table>

<p style="font-size: 80%">* All edits until this time will be in the data, later edits might be.</p>

<p>All times in UTC.</p>

<p>Updates are currently done manually about once a week until they have proven
to work reliably. It is planned to switch to daily updates as soon as
possible.</p>
