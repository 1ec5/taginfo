Tagstats
========

Tagstats is a C++ program to create all the database statistics from a planet
or other OSM file. You probably must compile this yourself and copy it in the
../sources/db directory. Tagstats uses the Osmium framework
(wiki.osm.org/wiki/Osmium) which must be installed on your system before
you try building tagstats.
