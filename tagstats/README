Tagstats
========

Tagstats is a C++ program to create all the database statistics from a planet
or other OSM file. You probably must compile this yourself and copy it in the
../sources/db directory. Tagstats uses Libosmium
(http://www.osmcode.org/libosmium/) which must be installed on your system
before you try building tagstats.
